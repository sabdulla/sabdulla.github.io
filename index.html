        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Sara Abdulla. I am a PhD-JD student at Northwestern University 
            studying Media, Technology, and Society. My advisor is Dr. Ignacio Cruz.
        
        I earned my B.S. in Neuroscience with a Minor in Philosophy from Georgia State University (GSU) in Atlanta, and my M.S. in Analytics from Georgia Tech. 
    At GSU, I studied the legal-ethical implications of neuropredictive technologies in criminal courtrooms with Dr. Eyal Aharoni. I also published a psychology book chapter on incels, an endeavor that began shortly after the Toronto van attack in 2018. 
    
        Before my Ph.D., I did an ORISE Fellowship at the CDC Roybal Campus working on enteric disease surveillance. After that, I worked as a 
Data Research Analyst at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington, DC. 

I am broadly interested in the intersections and co-creative processes related to human values and culture, power and law, and technology.
